## 🎓 About Me  
I'm an MSci Artificial Intelligence student at King's College London, with interests in machine learning, AI systems, and full-stack development. I enjoy building projects that solve real-world problems using code and intelligent algorithms. I'm seeking summer internship opportunities for 2026 to grow my skills in a hands-on environment.
